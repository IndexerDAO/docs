# InfraDAO Overview

## About InfraDAO

InfraDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to supporting the Indexer community within the Graph ecosystem.

Our mission is to empower new and aspiring indexers with ongoing education and project-based learning opportunities, as well as to drive innovation in the indexing space through the testing of R\&D efforts from core developers.

Our vision is to be a leading DevOps talent incubator for The Graph and the broader web3 ecosystem, and to be recognized as the foremost organization for indexers. With a strong focus on community building and collaboration, we aim to provide a supportive and empowering environment for indexers to develop their skills and bring exciting ideas to the table.
