# Indexer Operations and Containers

Containers play an important role in indexer operations in The Graph protocol. The Graph relies on a decentralized network of indexers who provide the computational resources required to query and index data from various blockchains. Containers provide a consistent and reliable environment for running the indexing software required by indexers. By packaging the indexing software and its dependencies into a container, indexers can easily deploy and run the software on their local machines or on cloud infrastructure. This makes it easier for new indexers to join the network and reduces the barrier to entry.

Likewise, containers provide a way to isolate the indexing software from the host operating system, which improves security and stability. Each container runs in its own isolated environment, so issues with the indexing software or its dependencies do not affect other parts of the system. This reduces the risk of conflicts and makes it easier to manage and update the software. Overall, containers play a crucial role in enabling indexers to provide the computational resources required by The Graph protocol. By providing a consistent and reliable environment for running indexing software, containers make it easier for indexers to join the network and improve the stability and security of the system.
