# Linux and Ethereum Clients

Linux and Ethereum clients are essential components of the web3 infrastructure, which powers decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. Linux, being an open-source operating system, is widely used in the development and deployment of web3 infrastructure due to its stability, security, and flexibility. Ethereum clients, on the other hand, are software applications that enable interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. These clients are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. The most commonly used Ethereum clients include Geth, Parity, and OpenEthereum. Together, Linux and Ethereum clients form the foundation of web3 infrastructure and support the growth of the decentralized internet.
